This library stores ACE indicators and algorithms accompanying the paper published in Lancet Digital Health [*"Identifying adverse childhood experiences with electronic health records of linked mothers and children in England: a multistage development and validation study, (2022).

**UPDATE July 2023:** To derive ACEs using combined maternal and paternal data, please see paper published in the Lancet Public Health  [*"Family adversity and health characteristics associated with intimate partner violence in children and parents presenting to health care: a population-based birth cohort study in England*](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00119-6)
