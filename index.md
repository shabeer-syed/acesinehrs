intro:
  - excerpt: 'We have developed and validated indicators for identifying ACEs in routinely collected non-identifiable health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs, A&E, hospitals before and after birth. This website provides information on definitions, concepts, measures, and  standardised tools to help users apply the developed ACE indicators to create “research-ready” datasets. [See the publication here.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00061-9/fulltext) See also the published [systematic review.](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/106/1/44.full.pdf)'
