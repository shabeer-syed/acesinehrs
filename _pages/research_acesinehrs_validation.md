# Identifying adverse childhood experiences with electronic health records of linked mothers and children in England: a multistage development and validation study

Link to publication: [https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00061-9](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00061-9)

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) refer to traumatic or neglectful events during childhood that can have a profound impact on a child's health and development. Recognising and measuring ACEs is crucial for implementing effective prevention and intervention strategies. However, the lack of validated indicators in routine electronic health records (EHRs) has been a major obstacle for policymakers and service providers.

To address this issue, a pioneering study was conducted in England to develop clinically relevant ACE indicators using linked EHRs of mothers and children. The study aimed to support longitudinal public health monitoring and enable early assessment of support needs for vulnerable families before and after birth. The researchers employed a multistage prediction framework, combining evidence from systematic reviews, risk estimation models, cluster analyses, and expert ratings.

The study utilised the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database, containing anonymised primary care data from a representative sample of UK general practices. Data from 211,393 mother-child pairs were included, and the follow-up period spanned from 2 years before birth to 5 years after birth. The researchers identified 63 ACE indicators grouped into six domains: maternal mental health problems, maternal substance misuse, adverse family environments, child maltreatment, maternal intimate partner violence (IPV), and high-risk presentations of child maltreatment.

Validation of the ACE indicators in a separate cohort confirmed their clinical relevance and accuracy. The full model, comprising all 56 ACE indicators, demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in identifying any child maltreatment or maternal IPV, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. Individual ACE domains exhibited a dose-response relationship with the reference standard, with broader domains showing higher AUC values but lower specificity.

The study's findings highlighted that 39.1% of linked mothers and children had ACEs recorded in primary and secondary care 2 years before and after birth. The majority of ACEs were identified from maternal records, emphasising the importance of adopting a think-family approach and utilising linked EHR systems to effectively detect and address ACEs.

Whilst the study provided valuable insights into the prevalence and impact of ACEs on families in England, there are certain limitations to consider. The lack of an independent reference standard might have led to potential overestimation of risk for families more likely to be noticed and recorded with ACEs. Additionally, the study's reliance on primary care data from the CPRD GOLD database might not fully represent all ACEs recorded in other data sources, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the true prevalence.

The study's groundbreaking work in developing and validating ACE indicators holds significant potential for enhancing early identification and support for vulnerable families. However, before routine implementation, further research is required to evaluate potential harms, ethical considerations, public acceptability, and the effectiveness of interventions in improving outcomes for children exposed to ACEs.

Overall, this study contributes significantly to the understanding of ACEs and their impact on child health, underscoring the critical role of integrated EHR systems in identifying and addressing these adverse experiences. By enabling early interventions and preventive measures, this research has the potential to positively impact the lives of countless children and families facing ACEs.
