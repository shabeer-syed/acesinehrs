**Note:** The indicators uses [control flow methods](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/control-flow.html) to implement rule-based algorithms must be applied to specific indicators (mainly HRP-CM) to prevent misclassification including age-restrictions, exclusions of accidental injuries, genetic predispositions (bone diseases), traumatic birth injuries or maternal-child transmissions during birth (see below).

## Code list dictionary

 | Provided variable | Description | 
 | --- | --- | 
 | **Code** | Data ready code. Contains CPRD GOLD medcodes and prodcodes (as used in the data provided by CPRD with added prefixes to prodcode), ICD-9/10 (removed punctuations for ICD), and OPSC-4 codes. Prefixes *`d_`* added to prodcodes and *`p_`* to OPSC-4 codes. Prefixes prevents de-duplication as different systems may use the same code for different descriptions. |
 | **Code original** | Original code as entered into respective system (removed punctuations for ICD) |
 | **Coding term** | Original code description |
 | **Indicator code** | Indicator code name | 
 | **Indicator specific** | Most specific indicator |
 | **Indicator 1** | Main ACE indicator combining multiple codes or measures as used in  validation paper | 
 | **Indicator 2** | Broader ACE indicator combining multiple codes or measures |
 | **Domain** | ACE domain grouping all indicators together (applicable for the overall code list) | 
 | **Severity** | Where applicable, this variable indicates the severity classification of the code description. *e.g. For alcohol misuse, `mild`, `moderate`, `severe`.* |
 | **Scale** | `1`=Indicates that the code and severity classifications are dependent on extra clinical information (e.g. frequency of alcohol consumption). By default, this is set to *`Mild`* for alcohol. See rule-based algorithms. |
 | **Reference** | `1`=code is part of family violence reference standard, `2`=code can be used as a broader measure of family violence |
 | **Individual** | `1`=code applies to child only, `2`=code applies to mother only, `3`=code applies to mother or child (i.e. either), `4`=code only applicable to female children |
 | **Coding systems** | `GP/primary care:` Read, OXMIS, Prodcode (prescriptions or items), CPRD REFERRAL FHSASPEC (field specific), CPRD REFERRAL NHSSPEC (field specific). `HES-APC/secondary care/ONS:` ICD-10, OPCS-4, ICD-9 (applies to ONS < year 2000), HES-APC DISDEST OR ADMISORC (field specific) |
