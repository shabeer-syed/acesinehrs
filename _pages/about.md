## Adverse childhood experiences
<img style="float: right;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabeer-syed/ACEs/main/smaller%20overview%20aces.png">
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic, neglectful or [violent](https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/) experiences in childhood. Examples of ACEs range from child maltreatment and witnessing violence in the home to growing up with a parent with a mental health problem [(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/fastfact.html). Studies estimate that approximately 1 in 2 adults in England reports experiencing at least one ACE in childhood [(2)](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72). ACEs are linked to considerable health burden in adulthood and can substantially pressure families, health and social care systems [(3)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(17)30118-4/fulltext).

ACEs are preventable. However, many ACEs are very difficult to identify in childhood. Most studies rely on adults' self-reports many years after the event and are prone to memory biases. This “time gap” also means data is collected when it's more challenging to prevent the harmful effects of ACEs.

## How can routinely collected non-identifiable patient data help?
Everyone recognises the significant challenges of identifying and monitoring ACEs across individual services and nationally.
We know NHS trusts, GPs, clinical teams and researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are routinely collected data from hospitals, GPs and other health systems. The data is often recorded "prospectively" or as  events happen and as part of routine care. The information is available shortly after a health care presentation and poses less burden to patients than completing a traditional research survey. All data is made non-identifiable and stored securely (watch the video below to find out more). EHRs also provide researchers with larger samples than self-report or interview-based samples. At a population level, EHRs can be used by healthcare organisations to identify at-risk groups, implement preventive measures, and allocate resources efficiently by analysing trends, patterns, and outcomes across patient populations. Clinically, EHRs can support streamlining workflows, assisting decision-making, and enhancing patient care. 

In the UK, mothers' and children's EHRs can be linked across services. The ability to link mothers' and children's records allows for measuring ACEs before pregnancy, throughout childhood and intergenerationally.

## Domains and indicators of ACEs?
We have developed *indicators* for identifying *domains* of ACEs among families using routinely collected health care data of mothers, fathers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5 years post-birth. [Find the publication here.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00061-9/fulltext)

Each ACE indicator represents a variable of grouped codes or measures for a potential recorded ACE in mothers, fathers or children. Indicators are further grouped into six or seven overall ACE domains.

# Aims / mission statement
We are passionate about using electronic health records (EHRs) to advance health care, social justice and policy for families and young people affected by adversity.

Whilst EHRs are routinely collected and readily available, there are significant challenges in using EHRs to inform practice and policy. EHRs are often stored in different databases, organisations and coding systems that can result in a complex and messy web of information, requiring specialist data management skills before it can be used. This becomes more complex when trying to study EHRs of families, which depends on accurate data linkage between parents and children.

> **Our mission is to help improve the health of families and young people by enhancing the methodological standard, accessibility and utility of data-driven [*think-family*](https://www.scie.org.uk/publications/guides/guide30/) approaches to study adversity using EHRs.**

> **The ACE indicators aim to provide a validated system to measure intervenable and clinically relevant ACEs with the potential to support [trauma-informed](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/SAMHSA-s-Concept-of-Trauma-and-Guidance-for-a-Trauma-Informed-Approach/SMA14-4884) data-driven research, public health, policy and health care.**

> **We are continuously developing the wwww.ACEsinEHRs.com platform to improve resources for researchers, professionals and policymakers.**

All platform activity is publicly logged. All code for data management and analysis is shared under open licenses.

We follow WHO's [Minsk Declaration](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/349095/WHO-EURO-2015-4177-43936-61918-eng.pdf?sequence=1) and view ACEs through a *"life-course"* and a *"trauma-informed"* lens. This approach acknowledges that risk is not static and depends on the interaction of multiple unmeasured promotive, protective, and risk factors throughout generations and people's lives.

# Limitations of ACE indicators 
It is essential to note that ACE indicators:
* There are methodological challenges in accurately linking children to their fathers (a long-standing issue of anonymised secondary and primary care data).
* Only identify experiences recorded in semi-structured coded non-identifiable data. Many children might have concerns recorded only in free-text data that
is not captured in coded data.
* Do not represent an exhaustive list of all possible adversities experienced by children
* Cannot make inferences about an individual. This means that indicators cannot be used to guide individual-level clinical decision-making, including screening, diagnosing or labelling children or families to be at risk of harm.
* Do not assume children with ACEs will develop poorer health outcomes. Most children with ACEs **do not** develop poorer health outcomes and show resilience.
* Do not account for different protective factors and contexts

The limitations of the "ACE" concept have been summarised [elsewhere](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-policy-and-society/article/introduction-adverse-childhood-experiences-aces-implications-and-challenges/A1E57E800C74406E84F93AB9F8CB125D).
