Introduction:
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are deeply impactful and potentially traumatic events that can significantly affect a child's health and development. They encompass a range of negative experiences, from child maltreatment and neglect to growing up in households with parental mental health issues and intimate partner violence. Recognizing and measuring ACEs is crucial for identifying vulnerable children and families and providing timely support. However, the absence of validated indicators in routine electronic health records (EHRs) has hindered progress in this area. This study aimed to develop clinically relevant ACE indicators using a comprehensive multistage prediction framework based on linked EHR data.

The Birth Cohort and Data Sources:
The study utilized data from a large, representative birth cohort of mothers and children in England, consisting of 211,393 mother-child pairs, linked through the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database. CPRD GOLD contains anonymized primary care data from a substantial portion of UK general practices, making it broadly representative of the general population. The cohort was followed from 2 years before birth up to 5 years after birth, with data from primary and secondary care, the Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care database, the mortality register from the Office for National Statistics, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015.

Development of ACE Indicators:
The study employed a rigorous approach to identify ACE indicators. First, 408 candidate ACE indicators were identified through systematic reviews and previous studies. These indicators were then assessed for relevance against a reference standard of child maltreatment and maternal intimate partner violence using a combination of predictive and explanatory approaches. An expert panel resolved disagreements, resulting in 63 clinically meaningful ACE indicators grouped into six domains: maternal mental health problems, maternal substance misuse, adverse family environments, child maltreatment, maternal intimate partner violence, and high-risk presentations of child maltreatment.

Validation and Findings:
The ACE indicators were validated in the cohort, demonstrating good balance between sensitivity (72%) and specificity (84%) for identifying the reference standard of any child maltreatment or maternal IPV. Overall, 39.1% of linked mothers and children had ACEs recorded in primary and secondary care from 2 years before to 5 years after birth. The findings underscore the importance of using a think-family approach and linked EHR systems to identify and address ACEs, particularly during crucial periods of prevention.

Implications and Future Directions:
The study's findings have significant implications for safeguarding children's well-being and informing early intervention strategies. ACE indicators could prompt early assessments of support needs for vulnerable children and mothers, leading to more effective preventive measures. However, before routine use, further research is needed to address potential harms, ethics, public acceptability, and efficacy in improving outcomes for children exposed to ACEs. The study authors have provided all included and excluded ACE indicators, fostering transparency and facilitating further evaluation.

In conclusion, this groundbreaking study marks a significant step towards identifying and addressing ACEs in a comprehensive and clinically relevant manner. By using linked EHR data, healthcare professionals and policymakers can gain valuable insights into the prevalence and impact of ACEs, leading to more targeted and effective interventions that safeguard the well-being of children and families.
