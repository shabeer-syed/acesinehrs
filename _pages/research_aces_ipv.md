# Family adversity and health characteristics associated with intimate partner violence in children and parents presenting to health care: a population-based birth cohort study in England

Link to publication: [https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00119-6](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00119-6)

## Introduction:

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) poses a significant risk to the health and well-being of families, particularly during the critical period of the first 1000 days after a child's birth. In the United Kingdom, parents and children routinely attend health care appointments for antenatal, maternity, and childhood vaccinations, providing an opportunity to identify and address IPV through a comprehensive think-family approach. This study aimed to evaluate the association between family adversities, parental health problems, and IPV during the first 1000 days to inform early identification and prioritize family-child interventions.

## Methods:

The researchers conducted a population-based birth cohort study using linked electronic health records (EHRs) of children, mothers, and potential fathers. The cohort included mother-child pairs and mother-father-child triads. Data from various sources, such as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Hospital Episodes Statistics, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation, were utilized. The study included families with births between April 1, 2008, and Jan 30, 2019, with a minimum of 1-year follow-up after birth.

## Results:

The cohort comprised 129,948 children and parents from 106,442 families. The prevalence of recorded IPV during the first 1000 days was found to be 2.1%. Additionally, 41.2% of families had experienced various family adversities during the same period. Maternal records captured most of the IPV and family adversities. The study revealed a strong association between family adversities and IPV, with an increased probability of IPV in families facing multiple adversities.

Moreover, families affected by IPV demonstrated a higher risk of parental physical and mental health problems, including chronic pain and depression. The likelihood of IPV increased with the number of different family adversities recorded and with each additional family member facing adversities.

## Conclusion:

This large UK birth cohort study sheds light on the crucial link between family adversities, parental health problems, and IPV during the first 1000 days of a child's life. The findings underscore the importance of adopting a think-family approach in healthcare settings to identify and address potential IPV cases. Healthcare professionals, particularly in primary and secondary care, should be trained to safely inquire about IPV when families present with adversities or associated health problems. Integrated think-family functions in electronic health record systems can aid clinicians in recognizing adversities across household records. To provide effective support, there is a need for sufficient trained professionals to respond to family adversities and IPV.

The study's insights can significantly impact UK policy and inform guidelines for prioritizing family-centered interventions and improving the health and development of parents and children during this critical period. By implementing caring and supportive responses to IPV disclosures, timely and accessible support services can be offered to families in need.
